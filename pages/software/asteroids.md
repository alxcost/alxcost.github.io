Description
-----------


A clone of the arcade shooter: [Asteroids]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29"). This was the first C++ program that I released to the public. It's also the first game Iâ€™ve tried to make and it was a lot of fun to program. The game engine was built from scratch, including the graphics, physics and logic.

Controls
--------

- Z - Fire
- Shift - Ready super shot
- Arrow Keys - Movement
