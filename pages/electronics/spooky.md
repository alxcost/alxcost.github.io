Extremely Damaged Hard Drive
----------------------------

A data server Hard Drive that somehow got extremely damaged, leaving a fair amount of black dust everywhere. Very noticeable deep scratches on all sectors of the platter, no data was salvageable. The HDD was never opened, and no cracks can be seen on the casing or cover, so how did so much dust get inside the HDD? The internal air filter is throughly saturated with dust, but surprisingly the intake air filter is clean, suggesting the dust formed inside the Hard Drive itself. It's likely that some internal component got loose and then decimated by the platters that rotate at 7200 RPM.

Burnt-out motherboard northbridge chip
--------------------------------------


Malfunction on the cooling fan caused the chip to overheat. Heat was apparently so high that neighboring capacitors bloated like hell and the PCB was burnt on the back.</p>

Sony Playstation 3
------------------

A filthy repair job seemingly done on a Sony Playstation 3. Excessive solder flux was applied everywhere by someone trying to reflow the soldering. Also, excessive thermal paste was applied in both the GPU and the Cell CPU, which made it extremely hard to clean everything up. Sadly I didn't take photos of it, so just imagine hard globs of old and expired thermal paste everywhere, falling everywhere as you take out the heat-sink. You can still see some of those globs in the picture.

Someone tried to jumpstart a car with non-jumpstart battery charger.
